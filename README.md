# Ninja-Monkey-Time
This is the final project created for my Game Development 1 course. while this is the final build, not all features could be included within the short time frame and small team. A simple rhythm based collect the falling fruits game complete with powerups and falling nasties, this basic build of the game allows for the creative freedom to include multiple other features to expand the game upon as more is learned about game development.

//KEY FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT IN THE FUTURE:

Include hurricane vfx which change level design and functionality including fruit falling speed, direction, and visibility

Include campaign mode along with endurance mode

(Implement touch screen functionality for mobile build?)
